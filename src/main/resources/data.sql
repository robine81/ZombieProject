It's dark now, and empty, but as the initial brain fog clears you realise that you're still at work behind the reception in the library. You're somewhat offended that no-one woke you up before they all left. You get a pang of anxiety as you remember that you have to get home and feed your cat, that you should've done so hours ago. But you can't quite remember her name. Or where you live. Or your own name for that matter. This nap has taken more of a toll than you could have ever imagined. You wipe the drool from your mouth and close the copy of The King in Yellow that you had been using as a pillow."),

All condiments are half full and of questionable expiration date. There is a pickle jar with a single remaining cornichon dead on the bottom.

You shared an interest with him and would talk jovially during your shared breaks. He seems to be in a mind of his own, not noticing your approach nor quiet attempts to greet him, steadily mopping away at the same spot. As you reach for his shoulder he swiftly jerks around. Blood. Peeling skin. Decaying flesh. An ungodly stench. From his torn out throat comes a horrendous screech. You are in danger."),

(23, "A1L3S5-heart-shot", "Your aim was steady, your shot clean. The hole gives you a clean view through his chest, where his heart once was, to the blodstained shelves on the other side.

Ahti and his cat were two grumpy peas in a pod, but he was kind when it mattered. You wonder who will be feeding his cat now."),

Shambling bodies circle the wreckage, drawn by the sirens or the flashing lights you are unsure. A discordant moaning from the horde of shamblers can barely be made out under the sirens. You hope that if anyone survived the crash they are long gone from here by now."),
